                "body_html":"<p><em>Larry Cohen reports from Iowa:</em></p><p>On a hot Iowa Labor Day weekend, everyone was feeling the Bern!</p><p>Bernie himself set the pace on Friday and Saturday, meeting with Native Americans and walking a picket line in Cedar Rapids.\u00a0 It has been widely reported that he is the first major presidential candidate to walk a picket line while campaigning since Robert Kennedy in 1968.\u00a0 For Democratic candidates since then, that can be taken as a commentary on the gap between their walk and their talk.</p><p>Workers were picketing Ingredion (emphasis on \u201cgreed\u201d). Formerly Penford Products, Ingredion produces starch for food products.\u00a0 When the new owners bought Penford they pledged to keep up employment and work with the union.\u00a0 But, as is often the case, after they took over they demanded massive wage and benefit cuts.\u00a0 Now, faced with continuing management ultimatums, the workers are picketing while they negotiate and are asking for community support.\u00a0 The CEO is paid $7 million a year and has a golden parachute of $28 million.\u00a0 The struggle of Ingredion\u2019s 160 workers and their families against management\u2019s greed is now gaining notice and media coverage across Iowa and beyond.</p><p>Bernie\u2019s Labor Day talk to the New Hampshire AFL-CIO underlined the difference between himself and other candidates.\u00a0 He emphasized his support for the $15 minimum wage, restated his opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership and, most importantly, connected his support for the expansion of collective bargaining rights to sustainable economic growth.</p><p>My own Iowa journey took me to seven Labor Day weekend stops in eastern Iowa in two days.\u00a0 In manufacturing towns like Cedar Rapids and Clinton, Davenport and Dubuque, the consequences of decades of failed trade policies were apparent in the factories that were closed and the cutbacks in those still operating.\u00a0 Union members and nonmembers, active and retired \u2013 working people almost universally opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Most were in disbelief that our government could continue to pursue foreign policy objectives that devastate communities, by cutting jobs and forcing our incomes to compete with unthinkably low wage levels.</p><p>A John Deere employee described his eight years on layoff as production shifted out of the country; a retired electronics worker described the size of his plant\u2019s workforce before and after NAFTA and our failed trade policy with China.\u00a0 Public sector workers well understood the connection between cuts in manufacturing and the pressure to close schools and cut public services.</p><p>On this Labor Day there was also hope.\u00a0 There was hope that Bernie and those of us supporting his political revolution can begin to find a path forward together.\u00a0 There was hope that, with a candidate who rejects super PAC funding, together one day we can end super PACs and billionaire politics.\u00a0 There was hope that we can fund free public higher education, instead of following the Iowa governor\u2019s plan to gut the University of Iowa and keep driving up tuition.\u00a0 There was hope that we can establish Medicare for All instead of continuing the cost shifting to the sick and injured among us.\u00a0 There was hope that we can reverse the attacks on collective bargaining and help workers build new unions, giving them a voice on the job and dreams of a higher standard of living.</p><p>I will remember my visit to eastern Iowa as a hopeful one.\u00a0 I drove almost 500 miles in two days with Bonnie and Steve, two great labor organizers with Communication Workers of America (CW). As we talked to thousands of Iowans, we recommitted to Bernie Sanders. We recommitted to joining thousands of volunteers across Iowa, and more than a million across our nation, in standing up and fighting back.\u00a0 Unless we stand for our own values and reject business as usual, we may miss the opportunity we have long imagined.</p><p><em>Larry Cohen is\u00a0chair of the Democracy Initiative and past president of Communications Workers of America (CWA). The views expressed here are his own.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

These working people, and their unions, resisted the oligarchs of their day, fought for a more responsive democracy, and built the middle class.</p><p>Today we can &#8211; and we must &#8211; follow their example. It&#8217;s time to rebuild the crumbling middle class of our country and make certain that every working person in the United States of America has a chance at a decent life.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve ever enjoyed a paid vacation, a sick day, or a pension, they are the people to thank. And if you don&#8217;t have those benefits on your job today, they are the people who can help you get them.</p><p>The economic reality is that while our economy today is much stronger than when President George W. Bush left office 7 years ago, the middle class is continuing its 40-year decline.</p><p>Almost all new income and wealth is <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/\">going to the people on top</a>, while millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/9/25/6843509/income-distribution-recoveries-pavlina-tcherneva\" target=\"_blank\">wages actually fell</a> for 90 percent of Americans between 2009 and 2012, even as they rose for the top 10 percent. While we have seen in recent years a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, 51 percent of African American youth are now unemployed or underemployed, and we have the <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/\">highest rate of childhood poverty</a> of any major country on earth.</p><p>As a result of an explosion of technology, productivity has risen in this country, but working people are not sharing in the wealth. For three decades after the end of World War II, productivity and wages grew together. Business profits rose, and the workers who made those profits possible did well along with their bosses. That&#8217;s not happening today. Productivity has continued to soar, but <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/\" target=\"_blank\">workers have been cut out of the profits</a>.</p><p>The time is long overdue for us to create an economy which works for the middle class and working families of this country, and not just the one percent. It is time for us to have a government which represents all Americans, not just wealthy campaign contributors.</p><p>At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we need a tax system which demands that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.</p><p>With real unemployment at over 10 percent and youth unemployment off the charts, we need a massive federal jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent paying jobs.</p><p>With many of our people working at starvation wages, we need to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next few years, and implement pay equity for women workers.</p><p>When hundreds of thousands of bright and qualified young people are unable to afford a higher education, we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt. And we can do that by a tax on Wall Street speculation.</p><p>At a time when 35 million Americans lack any health insurance and many more are under-insures, we need to move toward a single-payer health insurance program which guarantees health care to all as a right.</p><p>We also need to join other wealthy counties by guaranteeing that all families have paid medical and family leave and paid sick time and vacation time.</p><p>Instead of cutting Social Security or disability programs, as most Republicans want, we need to expand Social Security benefits so that every senior citizen in this country can enjoy their retirement years in dignity.</p><p>When many businesses are making it harder and harder for workers to enjoy their constitutional right to form a trade union, we need legislation which makes it possible for those workers who want to join a union to be able to do so. We need to pass the Employee Free Choice Act.</p><p>In the wealthiest country in the history of the world we CAN accomplish all these goals, but we can&#8217;t do it without a political revolution. We can&#8217;t do it unless millions of Americans stand up and fight back to reclaim our country from the hands of a billionaire class whose greed is destroying our nation.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the good news: we faced challenges like these before in our history, and we won. We won when working people across this country came together &#8211; in the workplace, in peaceful demonstrations, and at the ballot box &#8211; and said &#8220;No more.&#8221; That victory is part of what we celebrate on Labor Day.</p><p>By all means, enjoy the holiday weekend. But this Labor Day let&#8217;s also honor the men and women who have fought for the rights of working people in this country ever since it was founded &#8211; by pledging to carry on with the work they&#8217;ve started.</p>",
